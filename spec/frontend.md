## FEATURE:

- Netflix-style content discovery interface with horizontal scrolling card rows for AI/ML news aggregation
- Data source organization via horizontal card rows (ArXiv papers, HackerNews stories, RSS feeds, daily digests)
- Interactive hover animations with card expansion revealing AI-generated summaries and key insights
- Netflix-inspired content detail screens with options to read AI summary or open in-app browser
- Dedicated daily digest audio row featuring voice summary cards with integrated audio playback
- Smooth micro-animations and transitions throughout the interface without overwhelming users

- Modern React/Next.js frontend with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion animations
- Mobile-responsive design optimized for touch interactions and gesture-based navigation
- **Monochrome design system** with black/white/gray palette for professional aesthetic

## QUICK START GUIDE:

### Recommended Implementation Order:
1. **Start with static HTML prototype** (like hybrid.html) to validate design
2. **Move to Next.js** once design is approved
3. **Add animations last** - get layout working first
4. **Use mock data initially** - don't wait for backend API

### Key Design Decisions:
- **Monochrome only**: No colors except black/white/gray
- **No icons/emojis**: Use text labels instead
- **Large text**: Prioritize readability over density
- **Horizontal scrolling**: Core interaction pattern
- **Modals over navigation**: Keep users on main page

## FRONTEND COMPONENT TIERS:

## LEARNINGS FROM MOCK IMPLEMENTATIONS:

Based on our three mock implementations (V0, MockupV2, Qwen-mock, and Hybrid), here are the key learnings:

### Design System Best Practices:
- **Monochrome palette works best**: Black (#000000), grays (#1a1a1a, #333333, #666666), white (#ffffff)
- **No colors or emojis**: Keep the interface professional and focused on content
- **Font sizes matter**: Use larger, readable typography (text-lg for titles, text-base for body)
- **Proper spacing is crucial**: Use consistent padding (p-5 to p-8) for breathing room

### Layout Patterns That Work:
- **Hero section placement**: Large hero with featured content immediately grabs attention
- **Filter positioning**: Time/relevance filters work best under hero, not in header
- **Header style**: Borderless, gradient-fade headers feel more modern than bordered ones
- **Navigation placement**: Inline navigation in header (Netflix-style) over separate nav bars
- **Card dimensions**: 320px width (w-80) provides optimal content display

### Interaction Patterns:
- **Hover effects**: Scale 1.05 with shadow provides satisfying feedback
- **Scroll arrows**: Should only appear on container hover, not always visible
- **Modal behavior**: Click card to open, Ã— button or outside click to close
- **Audio player**: Fixed bottom bar that appears only when playing
- **Category tags**: Rounded pills (rounded-full) look more modern than squares

### Content Organization:
- **Source grouping**: Separate rows for each source type (ArXiv, HN, etc.)
- **Metadata display**: "Source â€¢ Time ago â€¢ Relevance%" format works well
- **Summary length**: 3-line clamp for card summaries, full text in modals
- **Key points**: Bullet points in modals for quick scanning

### Technical Implementation Notes:
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS can work**: Complex React isn't always necessary for prototypes
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides rapid iteration and consistent styling
- **CSS transforms**: Essential for smooth 60fps animations
- **Virtualization**: Not needed for MVP with limited cards per row

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Netflix-Style Performance**: Prioritize 60fps animations using CSS transforms and GPU acceleration
- **Horizontal Scroll Optimization**: Use `react-window` for virtualization to handle thousands of cards efficiently
- **Touch Gesture Implementation**: 
  - Momentum scrolling with spring physics for natural feel
  - Swipe-to-navigate between content rows on mobile
  - Touch feedback with haptic vibration on supported devices
  - Prevent scroll bounce and rubber-band effects on iOS
- **Animation Hierarchy**: 
  - Hover animations (scale 1.05, glow effects) have highest priority
  - Entrance animations (stagger effects) use optimal timing curves
  - Loading skeletons match exact card dimensions to prevent layout shift
  - Use `transform3d` and `will-change` for GPU acceleration
- **Netflix-Style State Management**: 
  - Cache viewed content positions for seamless navigation
  - Preload adjacent cards in horizontal rows for instant display
  - Persist user's scroll position within each row
  - Background prefetch of content modal data on hover
- **In-App Browser Integration**: 
  - Iframe-based browser with full navigation controls
  - Reader mode extraction for clean article viewing
  - Bookmark synchronization with main application state
  - Progressive web app features for offline article caching
- **Audio Experience Optimization**: 
  - Picture-in-picture audio player that persists across navigation
  - Audio preloading for instant playbook on daily digest cards
  - Background audio with system media controls integration
  - Automatic pause/resume based on user focus and visibility
- **Cinematic Theme System**: 
  - Netflix-inspired dark theme as primary with subtle gradients
  - Light theme optimized for reading with high contrast
  - Smooth theme transitions using CSS custom properties
  - Adaptive colors based on featured content imagery
- **Accessibility for Streaming UI**: 
  - Keyboard navigation with logical tab order through horizontal rows
  - Screen reader announcements for dynamic content updates
  - High contrast focus indicators for card navigation
  - Reduced motion preferences respected for all animations
- **Performance Monitoring**: 
  - Core Web Vitals tracking specifically for horizontal scroll performance
  - Animation frame rate monitoring to maintain 60fps
  - Memory usage tracking for virtualized lists
  - Network usage optimization for real-time content updates
