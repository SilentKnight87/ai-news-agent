## FEATURE:

- Community sentiment analysis from Reddit, HackerNews, and social media discussions
- Extract practical feedback beyond official claims (performance, compatibility, usability)
- Identify step changes vs incremental improvements based on community reaction
- Track sentiment evolution over time (initial hype → reality check → stable opinion)
- Surface hidden issues, gotchas, and real-world implementation challenges
- Provide balanced view combining official announcements with community validation

## CORE VALUE PROPOSITION:

Traditional news aggregation shows **what was announced**. Sentiment analysis shows **what actually matters**:

- **Official claim**: "2x faster inference"
- **Community reality**: "Only faster on A100s, actually slower on consumer GPUs"

- **Official claim**: "Easy to integrate"
- **Community reality**: "Breaks with transformers<4.36, undocumented API changes"

- **Official claim**: "State-of-the-art performance"
- **Community reality**: "Better than GPT-3.5 but nowhere near GPT-4, overhyped"

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

### Phase 1: Basic Sentiment Extraction (Month 2-3)
1. **Comment Analysis Pipeline**
   - Extract top comments from Reddit/HN discussions
   - Basic sentiment classification (positive/negative/neutral)
   - Key phrase extraction for common themes
   - Performance claim validation

2. **Sentiment Aggregation**
   - Overall sentiment score per article/model
   - Sentiment distribution visualization
   - Highlight controversial topics (mixed sentiment)

### Phase 2: Deep Insight Mining (Month 3-4)
1. **Technical Feedback Extraction**
   - Installation/setup issues
   - Performance benchmarks from users
   - Compatibility reports
   - Resource requirements reality check

2. **Comparison Insights**
   - "Better than X but worse than Y" patterns
   - Use case recommendations from community
   - Cost-benefit analysis from practitioners

### Phase 3: Temporal Analysis (Month 4-5)
1. **Sentiment Evolution Tracking**
   - Initial reaction vs long-term opinion
   - Hype cycle detection
   - Stability of community opinion

2. **Predictive Insights**
   - Early indicators of success/failure
   - Community adoption velocity
   - Red flags for overhyped releases
